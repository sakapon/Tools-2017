## Epidemic Simulator
Epidemic Simulator is a tool to simulate the SIR epidemic model described as follows:

```
S' = θR - βSI
I' = βSI - γI
R' = γI - θR
```

The simulation by this tool is a kind of cellular automaton.  
See [document](https://github.com/sakapon/Tools-2017/wiki/Epidemic-Simulator).
